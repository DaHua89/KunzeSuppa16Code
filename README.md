# Replication package

This repository includes the accompanying code to our term paper

<<Picking up the Bowling Pins: A Reproduction of 
“Bowling alone or bowling at all? The effect of unemployment on social participation” 
by Kunze and Suppa (2017)>>
  
the goal of which is the replication of the results obtained by 

<<L. Kunze, N. Suppa (2017) in "Bowling alone or bowling at all? The effect of unemployment on social participation", 
*[Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jebo.2016.11.012)*, 133, 213–235.>>

## Structur
The folder **code/** contains three .R files: 
1. **GetDataset.R** generates the **baseline data set** used in the term paper.
2. **Descriptive.R** ....
3. **Regression.R** ...  
4. **MASTER.R*** ...

## Data 
The baseline data set of our term paper was retrieved from the Teaching Version of the *German Socio-Economic Panel* (SOEP) data set, provided by the *German Institute for Economic Research* (DIW Berlin), for the years from 1992 to 2011. 
For copyright reasons, the SOEP data set cannot be made available here, but is available from the DIW upon request. 

## Note 
The main analysis is written in *R*. To run the code, *R* should be installed on your work engine. 
For the installation process, we suggest to follow the guidline provided by [Datacamp.com](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/installing-R-windows-mac-ubuntu).
